## Using a Jupyter Notebook

You can view and execute the R or Python code for this solution in a Jupyter Notebook by following these instructions. 

## Start Jupyter Notebook

Open a Powershell or Terminal window and execute the following:

    ```
    cd c:\Solutions\{{ site.folder_name }}
    jupyter notebook
    ```

After a moment, the browser window will open.  Navigate to the **Python** directory to find the {{ site.jupyter_name }} notebook.  Select the `ML Server` kernel for the Python notebook.


## Using Jupyter

To execute the code in a cell, `Shift+Enter` when your cursor is in the cell.  Some of the cells may take a minute or two to work, and must be complete before the next cell can execute.  You can also select the `Cell>Run All` menu item to execute the entire notebook.
